## Internet

## History Of internet

- founder: Advanced Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET)
- birthdate: 1969
- story:
- goals:
  - Basic purpose of ARPANET was to provide communication among the various bodies of government.
- steps of completion:
  - Initially, there were only four nodes, formally called Hosts.
  - In 1972, the ARPANET spread over the globe with 23 nodes located at different countries and thus became known as Internet.
  - By the time, with invention of new technologies such as TCP/IP protocols, DNS, WWW, browsers, scripting languages etc.,Internet provided a medium to publish and access information over the web.

## Internet definition

Internet is defined as an Information super Highway, to access information over the web. However, It can be defined in many ways as follows:

Internet is a world-wide global system of interconnected computer networks.

Internet uses the standard Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

Every computer in internet is identified by a unique IP address.

IP Address is a unique set of numbers (such as 110.22.33.114) which identifies a computer location.

A special computer DNS (Domain Name Server) is used to give name to the IP Address so that user can locate a computer by a name.

For example, a DNS server will resolve a name https://www.digikala.com to a particular IP address to uniquely identify the computer on which this website is hosted.

Internet is accessible to every user all over the world.

## Internet services

- Communication Services
  - Electronic Mail
Used to send electronic message over the internet.
  - Telnet
Used to log on to a remote computer that is attached to internet.
  - Newsgroup
Offers a forum for people to discuss topics of common interests.
  - Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
Allows the people from all over the world to communicate in real time.
  - Mailing Lists
Used to organize group of internet users to share common information through e-mail.
  - Internet Telephony (VoIP)
Allows the internet users to talk across internet to any PC equipped to receive the call.
  - Instant Messaging

Enable the users to transfer files.
  - Archie
It’s updated database of public FTP sites and their content. It helps to search a file by its name.
  - Gopher
Used to search, retrieve, and display documents on remote sites.
  - Very Easy Rodent Oriented Netwide Index to Computer Achieved (VERONICA)
VERONICA is gopher based resource. It allows access to the information resource stored on gopher’s servers.

- Web Services
Web services allow exchange of information between applications on the web. Using web services, applications can easily interact with each other.

- World Wide Web (WWW)
WWW is also known as W3. It offers a way to access documents spread over the several servers over the internet. These documents may contain texts, graphics, audio, video, hyperlinks. The hyperlinks allow the users to navigate between the documents.

## IP

unique logical address assigned to a machine over the network.

- IP address is the unique address assigned to each host present on Internet.
- IP address is 32 bits (4 bytes) long.
- IP address consists of two components: network component and host component.
- Each of the 4 bytes is represented by a number from 0 to 255, separated with dots. 
e.g.: 137.170.4.124
